          Walt Disney, C.V. Wood, Jr. and Harrison “Buzz” Price share plans for what would become Disneyland in Anaheim, California.

            Harrison Alan Price, familiarly known as Buzz, was born on May 17, 1921, in Oregon City, Ore., and reared in Southern California. As a child, he later said, he was a “numbers geek,” the kind of boy who kept a careful tally of the number of times he played each phonograph record in his collection.
          </p>
          <p>
            Mr. Price received a bachelor’s degree in mechanical engineering from the California Institute of Technology in 1942. After Army service in World War II, he earned an M.B.A. from Stanford in 1951.

            Buzz went on to join the Stanford Research Institute, where he was contracted by Walt and Roy O. Disney to determine the economic feasibility of and the best location for a new project, Disneyland. As Buzz recalled, &#x201C;I asked Walt if he had a bias about its location. Did he have any thoughts about where he thought it ought to be. He said, &#x2018;Absolutely not. You tell me where the best location is.&#x2019;&#x201D;
          </p>
          <p>
            After concentrating on Orange County, Buzz analyzed ten potential sites in that metropolitan area. Considerations included population, accessibility, climate factors, and more. Ultimately, Buzz, Walt, and Roy selected 160 acres of orange grove in Anaheim, near the new Santa Ana Freeway, as the ideal location for Disneyland.
          </p>
          <p>
            This land purchase marked the Company&#x2019;s first exercise in sophisticated location analysis and acquisition. Disneyland launched as the best-attended park in the world with about four million in attendance during its first year. Its attendance grew steadily over the next 37 years, at a compound rate of four percent, according to Buzz.
          </p>
          <p>
            Walt respected Buzz&#x2019;s talent and encouraged him to form his own firm, offering a three-year contract for research time. So, in 1958, he founded Economics Research Associates (ERA) and conducted studies for Walt Disney World and Epcot Center near Orlando, Florida. He also conducted evaluating studies for CalArts and for Walt&#x2019;s proposed Mineral King project, a unique Swiss-themed ski resort that would be located near Sequoia National Park in California. Walt&#x2019;s premature death, however, marked the end of the project.
          </p>
          <p>
            In all, Buzz conducted over 150 project studies for The Walt Disney Company, including site selection and feasibility for Tokyo Disneyland. His numerous non-Disney projects include master planning eight world&#x2019;s fairs, including Seattle and San Antonio; site and economic feasibility studies for Six Flags theme parks and Sea World parks; and planning studies for winter resorts, including Vail in Colorado.

            He &#x201C;was as much responsible for the success of the Walt Disney Co. as anybody except Walt Disney himself,&#x201D; Michael Eisner, former chief executive of the company, said in a statement.
          </p>
          <p>
            After Disney turned to Price in 1953 for advice on where to build his first theme park, the engineer analyzed population trends, land prices, accessibility and climate&#x2014;and zeroed in on a 160-acre orange grove in Anaheim.
            &#x201C;We hit it right on the nose, dead center,&#x201D; Price later said. &#x201C;That was the perfect place for it.&#x201D;
          </p>
          <p>
            Keith Murdoch, who was Anaheim&#x2019;s city manager in 1953, called Price &#x201C;a real visionary&#x201D; who was &#x201C;instrumental in expanding Walt&#x2019;s dream of a small park to one of worldwide significance.&#x201D;
          </p>
          <p>
            When Disney decided to build another theme park in the East, Price studied and discarded New York and Washington, D.C., before recommending the Orlando area for its mild winters and central Florida location. Disney World opened in 1971, almost five years after Disney&#x2019;s death.
          </p>
          <p>
            Nearly every amusement park built since the 1950s in some way reflects Price&#x2019;s approach to planning theme parks, according to experts.

            Buzz Price would be called upon frequently to weigh in on the viability of a Disney project, and he developed a research methodology that suited Walt and Roy&#x2019;s needs. The process that he used when working with Walt was a, &#x201C;Yes, if&#x2026;&#x201D; line of attack. Price said, &#x201C;&#x2018;Yes, if&#x2026;&#x2019; is the approach of a deal maker. It points to what needs to be done to make the possible plausible. &#x201C;No because&#x201D; is the language of a deal killer. Creative people thrive on &#x201C;Yes, if.&#x201D; He added that &#x201C;Walt liked this language.&#x201D;

            &#x22;From the time of his first involvement with Dad in selecting the site for Disneyland, Buzz was involved in nearly everything our family did,&#x22; recalled Walt&#x27;s daughter, Diane Disney Miller. &#x22;Dad&#x27;s unexpected death left two major projects incomplete... barely begun, actually,&#x22; Diane said. &#x22;But they were projects especially dear to Walt&#x27;s heart. Uncle Roy (Roy O. Disney, Walt&#x27;s brother and Chairman of the Walt Disney Company), led the family in continuing support of the California Institute of the Arts (CalArts), and in the Walt Disney World project in Florida. Buzz was involved in both, but CalArts in particular.
          </p>
          <p>
            &#x201C;Before he entered the hospital,&#x201D; Diane reminisced, &#x201C;Dad had placed a stack of notebooks in Buzz&#x2019;s hands, saying, &#x2018;Here, take care of my school for me!&#x2019; Dad knew the hands to place his dream in, that Buzz would see it through &#x2026; and he did.&#x201D;
          </p>
          <p>
            &#x201C;Few people have created the opportunities for learning and training young talent in the arts as Buzz Price did,&#x201D; stated Marty Sklar, President of Ryman Arts and retired Vice-Chairman of Walt Disney Imagineering. &#x201C;Whether we are film, theatre or theme park fans, we should all thank our lucky stars that Walt Disney had a &#x2018;numbers man&#x2019; who loved music, art and poetry.&#x201D;
          </p>
          <p>
            Price refined this innovative research process by hosting over 150 design workshops called &#x201C;charrettes,&#x201D; French for &#x201C;little carts.&#x201D; The workshop name was derived from the &#xC9;cole des Beaux-Arts period, when students in Paris would bring their paintings to be judged by their masters in the carts; and in many cases, the artists would still be working on their wet canvases while on the move. In modern usage, a charrette is a process whereby all those affecting and affected by the outcome of a project come together to collaborate on finding solutions. After extensive consideration and discussion, the group can begin to develop a consensus and establish clearly articulated performance goals that are specific, measurable, achievable, realistic, and timely.
